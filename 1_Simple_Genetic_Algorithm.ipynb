        "\n",
        "For the hyperparameter search of a simple CNN, a genetic algorithm is utilized, written in python. The concept is based on the article referenced [1], which is accompanied by a Kotlin implementation. The chromosome (gene sequence) of each generation’s individual is considered with a fixed length. Each individual is trained for a fixed number of epochs. The learning rate and the batch size are not optimized with this procedure, as for a fixed size of epochs, the models trained with a small learning rate or a large batch size would obviously have a lower fitness score than the corresponding score of models trained with a higher learning rate or smaller batch size. The population size is taken equal to 20 individuals and the evolution process is repeated for 60 generations. \n",
